                    <p>Apart from being a university student, I thrive on being active and engaged in various activities. When it comes to sports, basketball holds a special place in my heart. I’ve been playing since the sixth grade and even to this day it is a big part of my life. FYI I’m a four time intramural champion and took part in UCSD’s first ever Mens Club Basketball.</p>
                    <p>Aside from basketball, I find joy in hitting the gym and pushing myself physically. Self improvement has always been something I work towards and lifting has provided me a space to clear my head while making sure my body is healthy and active.</p>
                    <p>Video games are another passion of mine. To me, they are fun mind exercises that also allow me to nurture and maintain relationships with friends who aren’t in my vicinity.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to fashion, I appreciate how it allows individuals to express their creativity and personality. I enjoy experimenting with different styles, staying updated on the latest trends, and creating unique outfits that reflect my personal flair.</p>
                    <p>Music is a constant companion in my life. It has the power to uplift my mood, inspire me, and create unforgettable memories. Whether it's discovering new artists, attending concerts, or even trying my hand at playing an instrument, music always adds an extra layer of joy to my day.</p>

                      <p> The project focused on building an AI-powered Notes Generator. The goal was to create a system that could analyze PDF documents, extract key concepts, and generate concise study notes. The project utilized advanced natural language processing techniques and machine learning models to process and summarize complex academic texts. The system was designed with a Flask backend for API functionality and a React frontend for user interaction. </p>

                      <p> The project focused on developing a comprehensive methodology to estimate the expected number of customers affected by Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) events over a 10-year period for San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E). The goal was to quantify PSPS impact across diverse power distribution networks at span, segment, and circuit levels. The evaluation metrics used included PSPS probabilities, annual shutoff rates, and expected customer impact. The project began with extensive data analysis and merging of multiple datasets, including weather station data, wind speed records, vegetation risk indices, and conductor span information. Geospatial analysis techniques were implemented to join datasets and create visualizations of PSPS risk distribution across the service territory. A graph network object was built to represent the electrical grid and perform network analysis for tracing upstream connections. PSPS probabilities and expected shutoff rates were calculated at various levels using probabilistic methods and expected value approaches. The final analysis provided insights into the spatial distribution of PSPS risk and its implications for grid management and customer impact[1]. </p>

                          The project focused on building a Recipe Ratings Prediction Model. The goal was to predict the ratings of recipes by extracting features from review data. The evaluation metric used was RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), which measures the difference between predicted and actual ratings. The project started with a baseline model using nutrition-related features and then evolved to include additional quantitative features like minutes, n_steps, calories, n_ingredients, reviews, and description. Hyperparameters were optimized using techniques like Polynomial Features and Grid Search CV. Different models were evaluated, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forest classifiers. The final model selected was the Random Forest Classifier due to its high R^2 and precision scores.

                        <p>This project leverages data visualization techniques, including scatterplots and geographic graphs, to analyze the characteristics of top NBA players and teams. By examining metrics such as three-point accuracy and offensive efficiency, the project identifies key success factors for elite players. It highlights a league-wide trend towards an offensive playstyle, emphasizing the growing importance of offensive efficiency and three-point shooting. Additionally, the analysis explores the age at which players peak, team priorities between offense and defense, and geographical patterns among top players, providing a comprehensive view of what defines basketball excellence.</p>
